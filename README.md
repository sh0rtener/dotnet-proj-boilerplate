## I'm waiting for PR!
Indeed, I would be very glad if at least someone noticed this repository and helped me in the development.

## How do I launch it?
First, you need to clone the repository to your device. To do this, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/sh0rtener/dotnet-proj-boilerplate
```

Stable up-to-date versions will be on the main branch.

## How to use

Next, everything is quite simple, we launch the project:
```
dotnet run
```

We are greeted by an inscription like:
```
Choose project what you want:
1) Ddd
Write your choose here (write q to exit): 
```

It is necessary to write the NAME of the project, then everything is intuitive.

## Thanks

I will be very grateful if someone notices... this.
